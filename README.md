The group decided to make a “new version” of the extremely famous smartphone game “<b>Flappy Bird</b>” in which instead of controlling a bird, the user controls a bear. It was made using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. For the text we used the "Press Satart 2P" font Designed by  [CodeMan38](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/wiki/fntgrpcodeman38). We have chosen this font because is the same from Flappy Bird.

# FlappyBear

-   ALESSANDRO BRIDI
-   LUCA COMAI
-   STEFANO AVANZO
-   ALESSANDRO ZATELLI

The group decided to make a “new version” of the extremely famous smartphone game “**Flappy Bird**” in which instead of controlling a bird, the user controls a bear. It was made using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. For the text we used the "Press Satart 2P" font Designed by [CodeMan38](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/wiki/fntgrpcodeman38). We have chosen this font because it's the used in Flappy Bird.

### The Tasks:

**STEFANO AVANZO**: Graphic elements, CSS code, README.md file  
**ALESSANDRO BRIDI**: implements the logic code, GIT administrator  
**ALESSANDRO ZATELLI**: implements the logic code  
**LUCA COMAI**: implements the logic code.
